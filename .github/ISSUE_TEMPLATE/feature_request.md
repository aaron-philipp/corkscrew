## Summary
A brief description of the feature you'd like.

## Use Case

## Proposed Solution
How you think this could be implemented.

## For New Heuristics
If proposing a new detection heuristic:

### Category
Which category does this belong to? (Naming Patterns, Resource Symmetry, Temporal Indicators, Structural Realism, Configuration Entropy, Organic Signals, Code Artifacts, or New)

### Detection Logic
What patterns or characteristics indicate synthetic infrastructure?

### False Positive Considerations
What legitimate configurations might trigger this? How can we minimize false positives?

### Example
```hcl
# Example Terraform that would trigger this heuristic
```

## Alternatives Considered
Any alternative approaches you've considered.

## Additional Context
Any other relevant information.
